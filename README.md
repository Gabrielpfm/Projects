Repository containing my personal projects
Card Trading: Excel Spreadsheet for trading cards where you insert the ones you have for trading and the ones you need and it shows if any of the others in the spreadsheet have what you need.
Treinos: Excel Spreadsheet that makes easier to have workout routines where you simply put the exercises name, number of sets, repetitions and load in one tab and can use the other to select which exercises you will do.
